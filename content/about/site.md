This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the theme [PaperMod](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/) with a few tweaks here and there.

My usual workflow is to write up an article in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is a bit more pleasant for general markdown writing on my computers or phone, and then create the post in the command line and paste in the contents.

I host the whole thing using Github Pages out of [this repo](https://github.com/BrenTicus/brent-site).

Sometimes I pull random ideas out of places like [32-Bit Cafe](https://32bit.cafe/websiteideas/) to stuff some random extra pages in here. Why not? It's a personal site, not a professional blog.
